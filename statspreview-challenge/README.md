## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid areas
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to have a better understanding of CSS Grid areas and how useful they can be to create responsive aspects in an easier way.

### Continued development

I'll like to explore basic animations next. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - His videos were really useful to have a better grasp of basic CSS concepts, how to use Grid areas and flexbox to improve responsiveness.
